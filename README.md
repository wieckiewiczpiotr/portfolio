This repository contains few sample data analyzes and visualizations I prepared to show my current coding skills. I wanted each project to be unique and present various analytical techniques. However, if you do not have time to read all of them, I encourage you to check at least [Price predictions of real estates in Riga](https://github.com/piotrwieckiewicz/portfolio/blob/master/riga_real_estate/riga_price_prediction.ipynb) - it's based on real data and contains extensive data cleanup.

### Interactive visualizations with plotly/dash

**Important note!!! Bear in mind that interactive apps are located on FREE server, so it may take up to 20 seconds to run them.**

* [Financial dashboard](https://financial-sample-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)
  * Data for app is partially downloaded from various sources (and webscraped) and in some cases, independent of author, the data may not download properly. However, this should not affect the operation of the main charts in the application, but only less relevant information at the top of the page.
