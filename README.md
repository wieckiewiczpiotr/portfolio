# Portfolio
This repository contains few sample analyzes and visualizations I prepared to show my current coding skills.

## Machine Learning

* [Real estates in Riga - price predictions and analysis](https://github.com/piotrwieckiewicz/Portfolio/blob/master/riga_real_estate/riga.ipynb)

In this project I focus on cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating some simple machine learning models aimed at predicting prices for the sale and rental of real estates.

* [Bank's marketing campaign - customer classification and analysis](https://github.com/piotrwieckiewicz/Portfolio/blob/master/bank_marketing_analysis/bank_marketing_analysis.ipynb)

Analysis showing various techniques and prediction based on machine learning models - visualizing which clients the bank has already contacted (exploratory data analysis) and developing a predictive classification models that will allow easier identification of potential clients who are more willing to take the bank's offer.

The purpose of the following analysis is to present possible analysis techniques and examples of conclusions that can be used to, among others improving the supply offered to optimize the number of bicycles made available to customers and improve the company's profitability.

* [Air transport market in Poland - data preprocessing, analysis and autoregression](https://github.com/piotrwieckiewicz/Portfolio/blob/master/air_transport_analysis/air_passenger_transport_analysis.ipynb)

 The purpose of the following analysis is to present showing various techniques and prediction based on the autoregression model.


## Interactive visualizations with plotly/dash

**Important note!!! Bear in mind that interactive apps are located on FREE server, so it may take up to 20 seconds to run them.**

* [Financial dashboard](https://financial-sample-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)
  * Data for app is partially downloaded from various sources (and webscraped) and in some cases, independent of author, the data may not download properly. However, this should not affect the operation of the main charts in the application, but only less relevant information at the top of the page.

## Other projects

* [Analysis of the profitability of saving for retirement under PPK](https://github.com/piotrwieckiewicz/portfolio/blob/master/ppk_analysis/ppk.ipynb)

The purpose of the following analysis is to model how well Pracownicze Plany Kapita≈Çowe will secure for retirement purposes and whether it is worth putting money into them.
